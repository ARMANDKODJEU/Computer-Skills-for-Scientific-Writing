Leveraging 6G, extended reality, and Internet of Things big data analytics for healthcare
% This is a idea
The article deals with  on the contribution of 6G, extended reality, and Internet of Things big data analytics for healthcare
% This is a paragraphe 1
In recent years, the healthcare industry has faced numerous challenges including staffing shortages, limited human interaction, and slow adoption of telehealth technologies. Emerging technologies such as 6G communication, extended reality (XR), and the Internet of Things (IoT) combined with big data analytics promise to transform healthcare delivery by improving efficiency, productivity, and patient outcomes.
% This is a paragraphe 2
Firstly, 6G technology offers ultra-high data rates, ultra-low latency, and enhanced reliability, which are crucial for sensitive healthcare applications like remote surgery, holographic telepresence, and tactile communication. Compared to previous generations of wireless communication, 6G supports more efficient and dense connectivity necessary for smart healthcare systems.
% This is a paragraphe 3
Secondly, extended reality (XR), which encompasses virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (MR), is revolutionizing the healthcare ecosystem. extended reality technologies enable immersive visualization for surgical training, diagnosis, and treatment, thus providing new avenues for patient care and medical education. Advances in head-mounted displays have made extended reality technologies more practical for continuous clinical use.
